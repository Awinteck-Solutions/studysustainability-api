## üîê Authentication & Authorization

### JWT Token Authentication
- Most endpoints require JWT token authentication
- Include token in Authorization header: `Bearer <token>`
- Token obtained from admin login endpoint

### Role-Based Access Control
- **ADMIN** - Full access to all endpoints
- **USER** - Limited access to specific features
- **Public** - No authentication required for public endpoints

## üìù Request Body Examples

### Admin Signup
```json
{
  "email": "admin@example.com",
  "password": "password123",
  "firstName": "Admin",
  "lastName": "User"
}
```

### Admin Login
```json
{
  "email": "admin@example.com",
  "password": "password123"
}
```

### Create University Program
```form-data
title: Master in Sustainable Development
description: Comprehensive program in sustainable development
university: University of Sustainability
duration: 2 years
tuitionFee: 25000
uniprograms: [file upload]
```

### Create Scholarship
```form-data
title: Sustainability Leadership Scholarship
description: Scholarship for sustainability leaders
provider: Sustainability Foundation
amount: 10000
deadline: 2024-12-31
scholarships: [file upload]
```

## üóÇÔ∏è File Uploads

Most create and update endpoints support file uploads for images:
- Use `form-data` body type
- File field names vary by resource type:
  - `uniprograms` for university programs
  - `freecourse` for free courses
  - `professionals` for professional courses
  - `scholarships` for scholarships
  - `grants` for grants
  - `fellowships` for fellowships
  - `jobs` for jobs
  - `events` for events
  - `careers` for careers

## üîÑ Soft vs Hard Delete

The API supports two types of deletion:
- **Temporal Delete** (`/temporal/:id`) - Soft delete, data remains in database
- **Permanent Delete** (`/permanent/:id`) - Hard delete, data permanently removed

## üß™ Testing Workflow

1. **Setup Environment** - Configure baseUrl and other variables
2. **Authentication** - Login to get JWT token
3. **Create Resources** - Test POST endpoints with sample data
4. **Retrieve Resources** - Test GET endpoints (both admin and public)
5. **Update Resources** - Test PATCH endpoints
6. **File Uploads** - Test image upload functionality
7. **Delete Resources** - Test both temporal and permanent deletion

## üìä Response Format

All API responses follow a consistent format:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Operation completed successfully",
  "data": {
    // Response data
  }
}
```

## üö® Error Handling

Common HTTP status codes:
- `200` - Success
- `201` - Created
- `400` - Bad Request
- `401` - Unauthorized
- `403` - Forbidden
- `404` - Not Found
- `500` - Internal Server Error

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **401 Unauthorized** - Check if authToken is set correctly
2. **400 Bad Request** - Verify request body format and required fields
3. **404 Not Found** - Check if resource ID exists
4. **File Upload Issues** - Ensure correct field name and file format

### Environment Variables
- Ensure all required variables are set
- Update `baseUrl` if API is running on different port
- Refresh `authToken` if it expires

## üìû Support

For API-related issues or questions:
- Check the API documentation
- Review server logs for detailed error messages
- Ensure all required dependencies are installed
